### **Project Idea: Budget Tracker with Expense Categorization**

This project is a simple command-line **budget tracking application** where users can keep track of their income and expenses. The application will allow users to input, categorize, and analyze their spending habits by providing simple financial reports.

### **Features:**
1. **Add Income**: Users can add their income with a description, amount, and date.
2. **Add Expense**: Users can add expenses with a category (e.g., "Food", "Entertainment"), description, amount, and date.
3. **View Income and Expenses**: Users can view a list of all their income and expenses, either separately or combined.
4. **Filter by Category**: Users can filter their expenses by category to see how much they are spending on particular types of expenses.
5. **View Budget Summary**: Users can view a summary of their total income, total expenses, and the difference (i.e., balance).
6. **Budget Alerts**: Users can set a budget for each category, and the application will alert the user if they exceed the budget.
7. **Report Generation**: Generate simple financial reports (e.g., monthly expenses by category).

### **Requirements:**
1. **Data Storage**:
   - Income and expenses are stored in memory during runtime (using lists or dictionaries).
   - Data should be categorized (e.g., “Food”, “Utilities”, “Entertainment”).
   - Tasks should persist until the program ends, with an optional feature to save data to a CSV or JSON file for future sessions.

2. **Income and Expense Structure**:
   - **Income**: Description, amount, and date of the income event.
   - **Expense**: Description, amount, category, and date of the expense.
   - **Balance**: Automatically calculated as `total income - total expenses`.

3. **Income and Expense Operations**:
   - **Add Income**: Add a new income event with description and amount.
   - **Add Expense**: Add an expense with a category, description, and amount.
   - **View All Entries**: View both income and expenses, optionally filtered by category or date range.
   - **Filter by Category**: Users can filter expenses by category to analyze where money is being spent most.
   - **View Budget Summary**: Display the total income, total expenses, and balance.

4. **Budget Alerts**:
   - Users can set a budget for each category (e.g., max spending on "Food" is $200/month).
   - The application will alert the user when their spending in a category exceeds the set budget.

5. **Command Line Interface**:
   - A user-friendly CLI interface to add/view income/expenses, view summaries, and set budgets.

### **Example Interface**:
```
Budget Tracker Menu:
1. Add Income
2. Add Expense
3. View All Income & Expenses
4. View Budget Summary
5. Set Category Budget
6. View Expenses by Category
7. Generate Report
8. Exit

Enter your choice: 
```

### **Testing Requirements:**
- **Add Income**:
   - Ensure that income is added correctly, with all properties (description, amount, date).
   - Test that the balance updates when new income is added.

- **Add Expense**:
   - Ensure that expenses are added correctly with proper category assignment.
   - Validate that the category budget alerts trigger when a user exceeds their set budget.

- **View Income/Expenses**:
   - Test that users can view income and expenses, sorted by date or filtered by category.
   - Ensure that a correct balance is calculated by subtracting expenses from income.

- **Filter by Category**:
   - Ensure that filtering by category works, and only relevant expenses are shown.

- **View Budget Summary**:
   - Ensure that the budget summary displays total income, total expenses, and balance correctly.
   
- **Set Budget Alerts**:
   - Test that a user can set a budget and receive an alert when exceeding that budget in a category.

- **Generate Report**:
   - Test report generation, ensuring it correctly groups expenses by category and summarizes the spending for a month or period.

### **Implementation Notes:**
- **Data Structures**:
   - Use lists, dictionaries, or classes to represent income and expense entries.
   - Each entry (income or expense) can be a dictionary in Python or a simple class in Java. 
   - A dictionary could have keys like `description`, `amount`, `category`, `date`, etc.
  
- **Persistence**:
   - For more complexity, store data in a CSV or JSON file (even though this isn't strictly necessary for testing), allowing users to exit and return to the same data.
   - Use Python's `csv` or `json` module (or Java's `FileWriter`/`BufferedReader`).

- **CLI**: 
   - Implement clear, easy-to-use CLI navigation, and validation of input to ensure users provide correct data types (e.g., positive numbers for amounts).
  
- **No Extra Libraries**:
   - Stick to built-in libraries (e.g., `datetime` for date handling, `json`/`csv` for file storage, basic lists or dictionaries for data storage).

### **Possible Extensions (Optional Enhancements):**
- **Export Reports**: Allow users to export their financial report to a CSV or PDF file for external use.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Add visualizations such as pie charts or bar graphs to represent spending in different categories (though this would require external libraries, so it's an optional extension).
- **Recurring Expenses**: Allow users to input recurring expenses (e.g., monthly bills) that automatically add to their expenses at set intervals.

### **Why This is More Involved:**
- **Financial Logic**: This project introduces financial calculations like balance and budget limits, and requires careful management of different types of data (income vs. expense).
- **Categorization**: Handling categories introduces a level of complexity in both the data structure and the filtering system.
- **Budgeting**: Setting up budget alerts introduces business logic that must be carefully implemented to notify users when their limits are exceeded.
- **Report Generation**: Creating and managing reports for users to track their progress gives the project a more real-world business application feel.
- **Persistence**: Data persistence through file handling adds a layer of complexity in managing saving and loading.

This project is a significant step forward from the task management app and will show deeper programming skills in terms of handling different data types, financial calculations, and user-interaction design. It also introduces real-world concepts like budgeting and reporting that are applicable to many software development roles.
